  thoughts: What can I say but yet another classic entry in the MK franchise. Enjoyable to play on your own or with family and friends, it's one of my go to games when I want to waste away a few minutes (or hours!).
            Performance is exceptional as you'd expect from a 1st party game of this stature with the only noticable blip in 4 player co-op mode but considering the known limitations of the switch, it's remarkable that this is the only drop in framerate you'll notice.
            While i've seen complaints bemoaning the fact this game is a port of Mario Kart 8 for the Wii U, I think it was neccessary to release a game of this quality and magnitude in the firt year of the console's lifespan.

  thoughts: Initially a slow burner, it took me 2 attempts to get into this game. Being somebody completely new to the "Xeno" franchise, I didn't really know what to expect but following my epic 205hr+ journey in Hyrule I was looking 
            for another (J)RPG to sink my teeth into. The game consists of 10 chapters which tell the story of Rex and his Blade (more on that in a minute) Pyra/Mythra attempts to find the mythical place known as Elysium. The first 2 - 3 chapters are slow burners
            and unless you're willing to give the game a chance, there is absolutely nothing stopping you placing it on the trash heap. However if you persist you'll be rewarded with a captivating storyline, fanatastic combat mechanics and wonder at how a game like this can be played on a device like the switch.
