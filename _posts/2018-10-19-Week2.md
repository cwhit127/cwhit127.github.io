I was also introduced to the big wide world of continuous integration using Bitbucket and AppVeyor, something I never had to worry about at Tribal. The biggest thing I came away with this week was an appreciate for core web concepts such as DNS A/CNAME records, security headers and standard security techqniues you can use to try and secure your website as much as possible. Suddently things like the ASP.NET MVC ValidateAntiForgeryToken attribute made sense.
