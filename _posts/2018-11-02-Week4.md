As the clocks turned back and we entered the month of November another week at Razor flew by. Continuing the theme of personal and professional development, I was introduced to numerous new tools, nuget packages and technologies. Some of the highlights included using and (partially) understandng Azure Search. Using the Prefix profiling tool to inspect Entity Framework Core generated SQL and configuring my own local SEQ service to inspect Serilog messages. The only negative came at the very end of the week when it transpired I corrupted the test environment! Thankfully my line manager was merciful and helped me fix it!
