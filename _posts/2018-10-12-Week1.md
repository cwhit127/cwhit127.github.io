title: Week 1 Review
---

After 5 years at Tribal I took the plunge and began a new chapter in my life by starting a new Role at Razor. Unlike the past 5 years where I worked on a very large, powerful but ultimately static project (in terms of using new and emerging technology) Razor will offer the opportunity to work on a wide range of bespoke projects using the latest technologies and tools. On my first day I helped out one of my new colleagues with a Xamarin application for Android and iOS, my second day introduced me to the basic principals of Azure and the Azure portal and by the end of the week I was migrating a live Umbraco site from AWS to Azure. Talk about baptism by fire! For more information about my week, Azure, Xamarin, Umbraco and Serilog [click here][post]
